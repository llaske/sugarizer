Sugarizer Code of Conduct
=========================

To be effective, contributors of the Sugarizer project must work
together; this code of conduct lays down the "ground rules" for our
cooperative efforts.

We want a productive, happy and agile community that can welcome new ideas in a complex field, improve every process every year, and foster collaboration between groups with very different needs, interests and skills.

We gain strength from diversity, and actively seek participation from those who enhance it. This code of conduct exists to ensure that diverse groups collaborate to mutual advantage and enjoyment. We will challenge prejudice that could jeopardise the participation of any person in the project.

The Code of Conduct governs how we behave in public or in private whenever the project will be judged by our actions. We expect it to be honored by everyone who represents the project officially or informally, claims affiliation with the project, or participates directly.


Be considerate
--------------

Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on
the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and
colleagues, and we expect you to take those consequences into account
when making decisions.

Be respectful
-------------

Disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. We work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions and do our best to act in an empathic fashion. We don't allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.




Value decisiveness, clarity and consensus
-----------------------------------------

Disagreements, social and technical, are normal, but we do not allow them to persist and fester leaving others uncertain of the agreed direction.

We expect participants in the project to resolve disagreements constructively. When they cannot, we escalate the matter to structures with designated leaders to arbitrate and provide clarity and direction.

Ask for help when unsure
------------------------

Nobody is expected to be perfect in this community. Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so questions are encouraged, though they may be directed to the appropriate forum. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful.

Step down considerately
-----------------------

When somebody leaves or disengages from the project, we ask that they do so in a way that minimises disruption to the project. They should tell people they are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where they left off.


Leadership by example
---------------------

We all lead by example, in debate and in action. We encourage new participants to feel empowered to lead, to take action, and to experiment when they feel innovation could improve the project. Leadership can be exercised by anyone simply by taking action, there is no need to wait for recognition when the opportunity to lead presents itself.

Open meritocracy
----------------

We invite anybody, from any company, to participate in any aspect of the project. Our community is open, and any responsibility can be carried by any contributor who demonstrates the required capacity and competence.
