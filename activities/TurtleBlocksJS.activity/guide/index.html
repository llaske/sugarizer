	<h1>Guide to Programming with Turtle Art</h1>
	<p>Turtle Blocks expands upon what children can do with Logo and how it
	  can be used as the underlying motivator for “improving” programming
	  languages and programmable devices.</p>
	<p>In this guide, we illustrate this point by both walking the reader
	  through numerous examples, but also by discussing some of our favorite
	  explorations of Turtle Blocks, including multi-media, the Internet
	  (both as a forum for collaboration and data collection), and a broad
	  collection of sensors.</p>
	<h2>Getting Started</h2>
	<p>Turtle Blocks Javascript is designed to run in a browser. Most of the
	  development has been done in Chrome, but it should also work in
	  Firefox. You can run it directly from index.html, from a <a href="http://turtle.sugarlabs.org">server
	    maintained by Sugar Labs</a>, from the
	  <a href="http://walterbender.github.io/turtleblocksjs">github
	    repo</a>,
	  or by setting up a <a href="https://github.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/blob/master/server.md">local
	    server</a>.</p>
	<p>Once you've launched it in your browser, start by clicking on (or
	  dragging) blocks from the <em>Turtle</em> palette. Use multiple blocks to
	  create drawings; as the turtle moves under your control, colorful
	  lines are drawn.</p>
	<p>You add blocks to your program by clicking on or dragging them from
	  the palette to the main area. You can delete a block by dragging it
	  back onto the palette. Click anywhere on a "stack" of blocks to start
	  executing that stack or by clicking in the <em>Rabbit</em> (fast) or <em>Turtle</em>
	  (slow) on the Main Toolbar. The <em>Snail</em> will step through your
	  program, one block per click.</p>
	<p>For more details on how to use Turtle Blocks JS, see <a href="http://github.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/tree/master/documentation">Using Turtle
	    Blocks
	    JS</a>
	  for more details.</p>
	<h2>ABOUT THIS GUIDE</h2>
	<p>Many of the examples given in the guide have links to code you can
	  run. Look for RUN LIVE links that will take you to
	  http://turtle.sugarlabs.org.</p>
	<h2>TO SQUARE</h2>
	<p>The traditional introduction to Logo has been to draw a square. Often
	  times when running a workshop, I have the learners form a circle
	  around one volunteer, the "turtle", and invite them to instruct the
	  turtle to draw a square. (I coach the volunteer beforehand to take
	  every command literally, as does our graphical turtle.) Eventually the
	  group converges on "go forward some number of steps", "turn right (or
	  left) 90 degrees", "go forward some number of steps", "turn right (or
	  left) 90 degrees", "go forward some number of steps", "turn right (or
	  left) 90 degrees", "go forward some number of steps". It is only on
	  rare occasions that the group includes a final "turn right (or left)
	  90 degrees" in order to return the turtle to its original
	  orientation. At this point I introduce the concept of "repeat" and
	  then we start in with programming with Turtle Blocks.</p>
	<h2>1. Turtle Basics</h2>

		<p>Using the <em>Random</em> block from the <em>Numbers</em> palette to select a random
		  color (0 to 100)</p>
		<h2>A SHOEBOX</h2>
	<p>When explaining boxes in workshops, I often use a shoebox. I have
	  someone write a number on a piece of paper and put it in the
	  shoebox. I then ask repeatedly, "What is the number in the box?" Once
	  it is clear that we can reference the number in the shoebox, I have
	  someone put a different number in the shoebox. Again I ask, "What is
	  the number in the box?" The power of the box is that you can refer to
	  it multiple times from multiple places in your program.</p>
	<h2>2. Boxes</h2>
	<p>Boxes let you store an object, e.g., a number, and then refer to the
	  object by using the name of the box. (Whenever you name a box, a new
	  block is created on the Boxes palette that lets you access the content
	  of the box.) This is used in a trivial way in the first example below:
	  putting 100 in the box and then referencing the box from the Forward
	  block. In the second example, we increase the value of the number
	  stored in the box so each time the box is referenced by the Forward
	  block, the value is larger.</p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/boxes1.svg'</img></p>
		<p>Putting a value in a <em>Box</em> and then referring to the value in <em>Box</em></p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/boxes2.svg'</img></p>
		<p>We can change the value in a <em>Box</em> as the program runs. Here we add 10
		  to the value in the *Box( with each iteration. The result in this case
		  is a spiral, since the turtle goes forward further with each step.</p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/boxes3.svg'</img></p>
		<p>If we want to make a more complex change, we can store in the <em>Box</em> some
		  computed value based on the current content of the <em>Box</em>. Here we
		  multiply the content of the box by 1.2 and store the result in the
		  <em>Box</em>. The result in this case is also a spiral, but one that grows
		  geometrically instead of arithmetically.</p>
	<p>In practice, the use of boxes is not unlike the use of keyword-value
	  pairs in text-based programming languages. The keyword is the name of
	  the <em>Box</em> and the value associated with the keyword is the value stored
	  in the <em>Box</em>. You can have as many boxes as you'd like (until you run
	  out of memory) and treat the boxes as if they were a dictionary. Note
	  that the boxes are global, meaning all turtles and all action stacks
	  share the same collection of boxes.</p>
	<h2>3. Action Stacks</h2>
	<p>With Turtle Blocks there is an opportunity for the learner to expand
	  upon the language, taking the conversation in directions unanticipated
	  by the Turtle Block developers.</p>
	<p><em>Action</em> stacks let you extend the Turtle Blocks language by defining
	  new blocks. For example, if you draw lots of squares, you may want a
	  block to draw squares. In the examples below, we define an action
	  that draws a square (repeat 4 forward 100 right 90), which in turn
	  results in a new block on the <em>Actions</em> palette that we can use whenever
	  we want to draw a square. Every new <em>Action</em> stack results in a new
	  block.</p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/actions1.svg'</img></p>
		<p>Defining an action to create a new block, "<em>Square</em>"</p>

		<p>Using the "<em>Square</em>" block</p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/actions3.svg'</img></p>
		<p>The <em>Do</em> block lets you specify an action by name. In this example, we
		  choose "one of" two names, "<em>Square</em>" and "<em>Triangle</em>" to determine which
		  action to take.</p>
		<h2>4. Parameters</h2>
	<p>Parameter blocks hold a value that represents the state of some turtle
	  attribute, e.g., the x or y position of the turtle, the heading of the
	  turtle, the color of the pen, the size of the pen, etc. You can use
	  parameter blocks interchangeably with number blocks. You can change
	  their values with the <em>Add</em> block or with the corresponding set blocks.</p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/parameters1.svg'</img></p>
		<p>Using the <em>Heading</em> parameter, which changes each time the turtle
		  changes direction, to change the color of a spiral</p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/parameters2.svg'</img></p>
		<p>"Squiral" by Brian Silverman uses the <em>Heading</em> and <em>X</em> parameter
		  blocks. <a href="https://turtle.sugarlabs.org/?file=Card-36.tb&amp;run=True">RUN
		    LIVE</a></p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/parameters3.svg'</img></p>
		<p>Often you want to just increment a parameter by 1. For this, use the
		  <em>Add-1-to</em> block.</p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/parameters4.svg'</img></p>
		<p>To increment (or decrement) a parameter by an arbitrary value, use the
		  <em>Add-to</em> block.</p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/parameters5.svg'</img></p>
		<p>To make other changes to a parameter based on the current value, use
		  the parameter's <em>Set</em> block. In this example, the pen size is doubled
		  with each step in the iteration.</p>
		<h2>5. Conditionals</h2>
	<p>Conditionals are a powerful tool in computing. They let your program
	  behave differently under differing circumstances. The basic idea is
	  that if a condition is true, then take some action. Variants include
	  if-then-else, while, until, and forever. Turtle Blocks provides
	  logical constructs such as equal, greater than, less than, and, or,
	  and not.</p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/conditionals1.svg'</img></p>

		  color changes. <a href="http://turtle.sugarlabs.org/?file=Conditionals-1.tb&amp;run=true">RUN
		    LIVE</a></p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/conditionals2.svg'</img></p>
		<p>Conditionals along with the <em>Random</em> block can be used to simulate a
		  coin toss.</p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/conditionals3.svg'</img></p>
		<p>A coin toss is such a common operation that we added the <em>One-of</em> block
		  as a convenience.</p>
		<h2>6. Multimedia</h2>
	<p>Turtle Blocks provides rich-media tools that enable the incorporation
	  of sound, typography, images, and video.</p>
	<p>At the heart of the multimedia extensions is the <em>Show</em> block. It can be
	  used to show text, image data from the web or the local file system,
	  or a web camera. Other extensions include blocks for synthetic speech,
	  tone generation, and video playback.</p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/media1.svg'</img></p>
		<p>Using the <em>Show</em> block to display text; the orientation of the text
		  matches the orientation of the turtle. <a href="https://turtle.sugarlabs.org/?file=Media-1.tb&amp;run=True">RUN
		    LIVE</a></p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/media2.svg'</img></p>
		<p>You can also use the <em>Show</em> block to show images. Clicking on the Image
		  block (left) will open a file browser. After selecting an image file
		  (PNG, JPG, SVG, etc.) a thumbnail will appear on the <em>Image</em> block
		  (right).</p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/media3.svg'</img></p>
		<p>The <em>Show</em> block in combination with the <em>Camera</em> block will capture and
		  display an image from a webcam.</p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/media4.svg'</img></p>
		<p>The <em>Show</em> block can also be used in conjunction with a URL that
		  points to media.</p>
		<h2>7. Sensors</h2>
	<p>Seymour Papert’s idea of learning through making is well supported in
	  Turtle Blocks. According to Papert, “learning happens especially
	  felicitously in a context where the learner is consciously engaged in
	  constructing a public entity, whether it’s a sand castle on the beach
	  or a theory of the universe”. Research and development that supports
	  and demonstrates the children’s learning benefits as they interact
	  with the physical world continues to grow. In similar ways, children
	  can communicate with the physical world using a variety of sensors in
	  Turtle Blocks. Sensor blocks include keyboard input, sound, time,
	  camera, mouse location, color that the turtle sees. For example,
	  children may want to build a burglar alarm and save photos of the
	  thief to a file. Turtle Blocks also makes it possible to save and
	  restore sensor data from a file. Children may use a “URL” block to
	  import data from a web page.</p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/sensors1.svg'</img></p>
		<p>Using sensors. The <em>Loudness</em> block is used to determine if there is an
		  intruder. A loud sound triggers the alarm action: the turtle shouts
		  “intruder” and takes a picture of the intruder.</p>
	<p>Teachers from the Sugar community have developed extensive collection
	  of examples using Turtle Block sensors. Guzmán Trinidad, a physics
	  teacher from Uruguay, wrote a book, <em>Physics of the XO</em>, which includes
	  a wide variety of sensors and experiments. Tony Forster, an engineer
	  from Australia, has also made remarkable contributions to the
	  community by documenting examples using Turtle Blocks. In one example,
	  Tony uses the series of switches to measure gravitational
	  acceleration; a ball rolling down a ramp trips the switches in
	  sequence. Examining the time between switch events can be used to
	  determine the gravitational constant.</p>
	<p>One of the typical challenges of using sensors is calibration. This is
	  true as well in Turtle Blocks. The typical project life-cycle
	  includes: (1) reading values; (2) plotting values as they change over
	  time; (3) finding minimum and maximum values; and finally (4)
	  incorporating the sensor block in a Turtle program.</p>
	<h2>Example: Paint</h2>
	<p>As described in the Sensors section, Turtle Blocks enables the
	  programmer/artist to incorporate sensors into their work. Among the
	  sensors available are the mouse button and mouse x and y
	  position. These can be used to create a simple paint program, as
	  illustrated below. Writing your own paint program is empowering: it
	  demystifies a commonly used tool. At the same time, it places the
	  burden of responsibility on the programmer: once we write it, it
	  belongs to us, and we are responsible for making it cool. Some
	  variations of paint are also shown below, including using microphone
	  levels to vary the pen size as ambient sound-levels change. Once
	  learners realize that they can make changes to the behavior of their
	  paint program, they become deeply engaged. How will you modify paint?</p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/paint1.svg'</img></p>
		<p>In its simplest form, paint is just a matter of moving the turtle to
		  whereever the mouse is positioned.</p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/paint2.svg'</img></p>
		<p>Adding a test for the mouse button lets us move the turtle without
		  leaving a trail of ink.</p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/paint3.svg'</img></p>
		<p>In this example, we change the pen size based on the volume of
		  microphone input.</p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/paint4.svg'</img></p>
		<p>In another example, inspired by a student in a workshop in Colombia,
		  we use time to change both the pen color and the pen size. <a href="http://turtle.sugarlabs.org/?file=Paint-4.tb&amp;run=true">RUN
		    LIVE</a></p>
		<h2>Example: Slide Show</h2>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/slideshow1.svg'</img></p>
		<p>Why use Powerpoint when you can write Powerpoint? In this example, an
		  Action stack is used to detect keyboard input: if the keyboard value
		  is zero, then no key has been pressed, so we call the action again. If
		  a key is pressed, the keyboard value is greater than zero, so we
		  return from the action and show the next image.</p>
		<h2>Example: Keyboard input</h2>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/keyboard.svg'</img></p>
		<p>In order to grab keycodes from the keyboard, you need to use a *While*
		  block. In the above example, we store the keyboard value in a box,
		  test it, and if it is > 0, return the value.</p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/keyboard2.svg'</img></p>
		<p>If you want to convert the keycode to a alphanumeric character, you
		  need to use the *To ASCII* block. E.g., <em>toASCII(65) = A</em></p>
		<h2>8. Turtles, Sprites, Buttons, and Events</h2>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/turtles1.svg'</img></p>
		<p>A separate turtle is created for each <em>Start</em> block. The turtles run
		  their code in parallel with each other whenever the <em>Run</em> button is
		  clicked. Each turtle maintains its own set of parameters for position,
		  color, pen size, pen state, etc. In this example, three different
		  turtles draw three different shapes.</p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/turtles2.svg'</img></p>
		<p>Custom graphics can be applied to the turtles, using the <em>Shell</em>block
		  on the <em>Media</em> palette. Thus you can treat turtles as sprites that can
		  be moved around the screen. In this example, the sprite changes back
		  and forth between two states as it moves across the screen.</p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/turtles3.svg'</img></p>
		<p>Turtles can be programmed to respond to a "click" event, so they can
		  be used as buttons. In this example, each time the turtle is clicked,
		  the action is run, which move the turtle to a random location on the
		  screen.</p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/turtles4.svg'</img></p>
		<p>Events can be broadcast as well. In this example, another variant on
		  Paint, turtle "buttons", which listen for "click" events, are used to
		  broadcast change-color events. The turtle used as the paintbrush is
		  listening for these events.</p>
		<h2>9. Advanced Actions</h2>
	<p>Sometime you might want an action to not just run a stack of blocks
	  but also to return a value. This is the role of the return block. If
	  you put a return block into a stack, then the action stack becomes a
	  calculate stack.</p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/actions4.svg'</img></p>
		<p>In this example, a <em>Calculate</em> stack is used to return the current
		  distance of the turtle from the center of the screen. Renaming an
		  action stack that has a <em>Return</em> block will cause the creation of a new
		  block in the <em>Actions</em> palette that can be used to reference the return
		  value: in this case, a <em>Distance</em> block is created.</p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/actions6.svg'</img></p>
		<p>You can also pass arguments to an <em>Action</em> stack. In this example, we
		  calculate the distance between the turtle and an arbitrary point on
		  the screen by passing x and y coordinates in the <em>Calculate</em>
		  block. You add additional arguments by dragging them into the "clamp".</p>
	<p>Note that args are local to <em>Action</em> stacks, but boxes are not. If you
	  planned to use an action in a recursive function, you had best avoid
	  boxes.</p>
	<h2>Example: Fibonacci</h2>
	<p>Calculating the Fibonacci sequence is often done using a resursive
	  method. In the example below, we pass an argument to the <em>Fib</em> action,
	  which returns a value if the argument is &lt; 2; otherwise it returns
	  the sum of the result of calling the <em>Fib</em> action with argument - 1 and
	  argument - 2.</p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/fibonacci1.svg'</img></p>

		    LIVE</a></p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/fibonacci2.svg'</img></p>
		<p>In the second example, we use a <em>Repeat</em> loop to generate the first six
		  Fibonacci numbers and use them to draw a nautilus.</p>

	    LIVE</a></p>
	<h2>Example: Reflection Paint</h2>
	<p>By combining multiple turtles and passing arguments to actions, we can
	  have some more fun with paint. In the example below, the <em>Paint Action</em>
	  uses <em>Arg 1</em> and <em>Arg 2</em> to reflect the mouse coordinates about the y and
	  x axes. The result is that the painting is reflected into all four
	  quadrants.</p>

		<p>Reflection Paint <a href="http://turtle.sugarlabs.org/?file=Reflection-Paint.tb&amp;run=true">RUN LIVE</a></p>
		<h2>10. Advanced Boxes</h2>
	<p>Sometimes it is more convenient to compute the name of a <em>Box</em> than to
	  specify it explicitly. (Note that the <em>Do</em> block affords a similar
	  mechanism for computing the names of actions.)</p>
	<p>In the following examples, we use this to accumulate the results of
	  toss a pair of dice 100 times (example inspired by Tony Forster).</p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/boxes4.svg'</img></p>
		<p>Rather than specifying a box to hold each possible result (2 through
		  12), we use a <em>Box</em> as a counter (index) and create a box with the name
		  of the current value in the counter and store in that box a value of
		  0.</p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/boxes5.svg'</img></p>
		<p>Next we add an <em>Action</em> to toss the dice 100 times. To simulate tossing
		  a pair of dice, we sum two random numbers between 1 and 6. We use the
		  result as the name of the box we want to increment. So for example, if
		  we throw a 7, we add one to the <em>Box</em> named 7. In this way we increment
		  the value in the appropriate <em>Box</em>.</p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/boxes6.svg'</img></p>
		<p>Finally, we plot the results. Again, we use a <em>Box</em> as a counter ("index")
		  and call the <em>Plot Action</em> in a loop. In the <em>Bar Action</em>, we draw a
		  rectangle of length value stored in the <em>Box</em> with the name of the
		  current value of the index. E.g., when the value in the index <em>Box</em> equals
		  2, the turtle goes forward by the value in <em>Box 2</em>, which is the
		  accumulated number of times that the dice toss resulted in a 2; when
		  the value in the <em>Index Box</em> is 3, the turtle goes forward by the value
		  in <em>Box 3</em>, which is the accumulated number of times that the dice toss
		  resulted in a 3; etc.</p>
		<h2>11. The Heap</h2>
	<p>Sometimes you need a place to temporarily store data. One way to do it
	  is with boxes (as mentioned at the end of the Boxes section of this
	  guide, they can be used as a dictionary or individual keyword-value
	  pairs). However, sometimes it is nice to simply use a heap.</p>
	<p>A heap is a essential a pile. The first thing you put on the heap is
	  on the bottom. The last thing you put on the heap is on the top. You
	  put things onto the heap using the <em>Push</em> block. You take things off of
	  the heap using the <em>Pop</em> block. In Turtle Blocks, the heap is first-in
	  last-out (FILO), so you pop things off of the heap in the reverse
	  order in which you put them onto the heap.</p>
	<p>There is also an <em>Index</em> block that lets you refer to an item in the
	  heap by an index. This essentially lets you treat the heap as an
	  array. Some other useful blocks include a block to empty the heap, a
	  block that returns the length of the heap, a block that saves the heap
	  to a file, and a block that loads the heap from a file.</p>
	<p>In the examples below we use the heap to store a drawing made with a
	  paint program similar to the previous examples and then to playback
	  the drawing by popping points off of the heap.</p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/heap1.svg'</img></p>
		<p>In the first example, we simply push the turtle position whenever we
		  draw, along with the pen state. Note since we pop in the reverse order
		  that we push, we push y, then x, then the mouse state.</p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/heap2.svg'</img></p>
		<p>In the second example, we pop pen state, x, and y off of the heap and
		  playback our drawing.</p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/heap3.svg'</img></p>
		<p>Use the <em>Save Heap</em> block to save the state of the heap to a file. In
		  this example, we save our drawing to a file for playback later.</p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/heap4.svg'</img></p>
		<p>Use the <em>Load Heap</em> block to load the heap from data saved in a file. In
		  this example, we playback the drawing from data stored in a file.</p>
		<h2>12. Extras</h2>
	<p>The <em>Extras</em> palette is full of utilities that help you use your
	  project's output in different ways.</p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/extras1.svg'</img></p>
		<p>The <em>Save as SVG</em> block will save your drawing as simple vector graphics
		  (SVG), a format compatible with HTML5 and many image manipulation
		  programs, e.g., Inkscape. In the example above, we use it to save a
		  design in a from that can be converted to STL, a common file format
		  used by 3D printers. A few things to take note of: (1) the <em>No
		    Background</em> block is used to suppress the inclusion of the background
		  fill in the SVG output; (2) <em>Hollow lines</em> are used to make graphic have
		  dimension; and (3) the <em>Save as SVG</em> block writes to the Downloads
		  directory on your computer. (Josh Burker introduced me to Tinkercad, a
		  website that can be used to convert SVG to STL.)</p>
		<h2>13. Debugging Aids</h2>
	<p>Probably the most oft-used debugging aid in any language is the print
	  statement. In Turtle Blocks, it is also quite useful. You can use it
	  to examine the value of parameters and variables (boxes) and to
	  monitor progress through a program.</p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/debugging1.svg'</img></p>
		<p>In this example, we use the addition operator to concatinate strings
		  in a print statement. The mouse x + ", " + mouse y are printed in the
		  inner loop.</p>
	<p>Parameter blocks, boxes, arithmetic and boolean operators, and many
	  sensor blocks will print their current value as the program runs when
	  running in "slow" or "step-by-step" mode, obviating the need to use
	  the Print block in many situations.</p>
	<p>The <em>Wait</em> block will pause program execution for some number (or
	  fractions) of seconds.</p>
	<p>The <em>Hide</em> and <em>Show</em> blocks can be used to set "break points". When a
	  <em>Hide</em> block is encountered, the blocks are hidden and the program
	  proceeds at full speed. When a <em>Show</em> block is encountered, the program
	  proceeds at a slower pace an the block values are shown.</p>
	<p><img src='https://rawgithub.com/walterbender/turtleblocksjs/master/guide/debugging2.svg'</img></p>
		<p>A <em>Show</em> block is used to slow down execution of the code in an <em>Action</em>
		  stack in order to facilitate debugging. In this case, we slow down
		  during playback in order to watch the values popped off the heap.</p>
		<h2>14. Advanced Color</h2>
	<p>The internal representation of color in Turtle Blocks is based on the
	  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munsell_color_system">Munsell color
	    system</a>. It is a
	  three-dimensional system: (1) hue (red, yellow, green, blue, and
	  purple), (2) value (black to white), and (3) chroma (gray to vivid).</p>
	<p>There are parameters for each color dimension and corresponding
	  "setters". All three dimensions have been normalized to run from 0 to
	  100. For Hue, 0 maps to Munsell 0R. For Value, 0 maps to Munsell value
	  0 (black) and 100 maps to Munsell value 10 (white). For chroma, 0 maps
	  to Munsell chroma 0 (gray) and 100 maps to Munsell chroma 26 (spectral
	  color).</p>
	<p>A note about Chroma: In the Munsell system, the maximum chroma of
	  each hue varies with value. To simplify the model, if the chroma
	  specified is greated than the maximum chroma available for a hue/value
	  pair, the maximum chroma available is used.</p>
	<p>The <em>Set Color</em> block maps the three dimensions of the Munsell color
	  space into one dimension. It always returns the maximum value/chroma
	  pair for a given hue, ensuring vivid colors. If you want to more
	  subtle colors, be sure to use the <em>Set Hue</em> block rather than the <em>Set
	    Color</em> block.</p>

		<p>Color vs. hue example <a href="https://turtle.sugarlabs.org/?file=Color-vs-Hue.tb&amp;run=true">RUN LIVE</a></p>
	<p>To set the background color, use the <em>Background</em> block. It will set the
	  background to the current hue/value/chroma triplet.</p>
