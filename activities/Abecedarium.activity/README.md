# What is Abecedarium ?

Abecedarium is an abecedary activity to learn its alphabet using images, sounds and words.

Abecedarium has two parts:
* Learn: To explore the words by letters or by theme (Nature, Body parts, Things, Concepts),
* Play: Six little games to match pictures/sounds/words with possibility to filter by letter or by theme,
* Build: It will allow to build little stories combining images and sounds from the database.

All words could be seen in upper case, lower case or script.
Abecedarium could be use both in English (about 500 words in the database), in French (about 1000 words in the database) and in Spanish (about 600 words in the database).
All contents come from the Art4apps library. See Credits page for more.
