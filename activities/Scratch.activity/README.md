Scratch is an adaptation to Sugarizer of [Scratch 3.0](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-gui) by Emily, a GCI`17 participant for Sugar Labs.

The initial work by Emily could be found [here](https://github.com/EmilyOng/Scratch.activity).
The current work comes from an update of this work by Lionel. See  [here](https://github.com/EmilyOng/Scratch.activity/issues/3).
