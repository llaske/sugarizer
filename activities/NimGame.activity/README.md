## Game Rule

There are several rows of coins below. Each player must pick a row and take at least one coin when it is player's turn. So the one **who takes the last coin** is the winner.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut         | Action      |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| `N`              | New game    |
| `Enter`, `Space` | Pass turn   |
| `Esc`            | Options     |
| `1`         | First row  |
| `2`         | Second row |
| `3`         | Third row  |
| `4`         | Forth row  |
