The player with the white pieces goes first.The aim of the game is to trap your opponent's king, which is called Checkmate.A game can end in a draw, in which case neither player wins.
AboutPiecesTitle=About pieces
AboutPiecesContent=Each player has an army consisting of a king, a queen, two rooks, two bishops, and two knights, and eight pawns.
AboutPawn=For first move, each pawn has the option to move forward one space or two spaces. After this move, they can only move one space forward. However, they are also the only chess piece that captures in a method different from how they move. To capture, the Pawn moves diagonally one space.
AboutPawnPromotion=If the Pawn reaches the opposite side of the chessboard, it has the unique ability to promote to another chess piece. The pawn can become a Queen, Bishop, Rook, or Knight.You can choose by clicking on this button.There are no restrictions to how many pieces of a given type you can have via promotion.
AboutRook=The rook can move horizontally and vertically, but not diagonally.Rooks are not allowed to jump over pieces.
AboutKnight=The knight move is often described as L-shaped. In a single move, it can go to a square that is two squares horizontally and one square vertically away, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally away.Unlike most pieces, the knight is allowed to jump over other pieces, although it is not allowed to jump into a square occupied by a piece of the same color.

AboutCheck=If the king is in a square that is under attack by an enemy piece, he is "in check". If a player's king is in check, the player is required to move his king out of check on the current move.The player is not allowed to put his king in check. This means that he cannot move his king into a square that is under attack, or in other words, a square that an enemy piece could move to on the next turn.
AboutCheckmateTitle=About Checkmate
AboutCheckmate=If the king is under attack and there is no way for him to escape, this situation is called "checkmate". The objective of chess is to checkmate the enemy king, so when checkmate is achieved, the game is over.
AboutStalemateTitle=About Stalemate
AboutStalemate=When a player has no legal moves on his turn, this is called stalemate. When stalemate occurs, the game ends in a draw.
AboutCastlingTitle=About Castling
AboutCastling= The king is allowed to perform a special move called castling, where the king moves two squares to the left or right, and the rook that the king moved toward is placed on the square that the king jumped over. A king is only allowed to do this once per game, with the following restrictions:1. The king and the rook involved in the castling must not have moved yet during the game. 2. The squares between the king and rook involved in the castling must be empty. 3. Castling cannot be performed if the king is in check or if either of the two squares that the king will move through are under attack.
