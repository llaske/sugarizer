As all Open Source software, contributions to Sugarizer are welcome.

The best way to start is to read the [architecture](docs/architecture.md) then to do the whole [tutorial](docs/tutorial.md). It will give you a good understanding of Sugarizer internal.

Then, you could start to contribute by trying to fix some existing issues [here](https://github.com/llaske/Sugarizer/issues).

Note than the **master** branch of the repository is for released/stable version, the **dev** branch is for development. So to contribute:

* [ ] Clone this repository,
* [ ] Fork the **dev** branch of your new repository,
* [ ] Update this new branch with your contribution and commit your changes,
* [ ] Send a pull request from your new branch to the dev branch of this repository.

Few rules to respect when you fix an issue:

* [ ] Ensure your pull request contains only update related to the fix,
* [ ] Respect indentation of the original file,
* [ ] Mention the issue number in the pull request but not in the commit message


Please note there is <u>no need to ask permission to work on an issue</u>. You should check for pull requests linked to an issue you are addressing; if there are none, then assume nobody has done anything. Begin to fix the problem, test, make your commits, push your commits, then make a pull request. These practices allow the competition of ideas and give priority to meritocracy.

Thanks in advance for your contribution.
