# Migrate Activities to i18next internationalization framework
Currently Sugarizer activity relies on [WebL10n localizaton framework](https://github.com/fabi1cazenave/webL10n) which is outdated and no longer actively maintained. In order to ensure continued support and modern localization capabilities, it is recommended to migrate the activities to the [i18next internationalization framework](https://www.i18next.com/).

Activities either use vanilla javascript or Vue.JS depending on that choose your path.
