# Step 0: set up the development environment
*(Estimated time: 15mn)*


For this tutorial, you will just need a browser and a text editor.
We will run Sugarizer from a local directory that will contain all files needed.

### Create the Sugarizer directory

To start, download **Sugarizer** from [here](https://github.com/llaske/sugarizer/archive/dev.zip). It's a 250Mb package so it could take some time. Once downloaded, unzip it. 

If you're familiar with **git**, you could clone the repository - dev branch - instead like this:

	git clone -b dev https://github.com/llaske/sugarizer

Whatever method used, you should have at end a Sugarizer directory like this:

### Run Sugarizer

We will use **Chrome** in this tutorial but any other browser will work as well. 

To run Sugarizer locally in Chrome, close any running instances of Chrome and re-launch it using the command line:

    chrome --allow-file-access-from-files index.html

* On this line `chrome` is the name of the Chrome executable file. Depending of your system it could be `google-chrome` or `"C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"` or `open -n /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --args` instead.

* The option `--allow-file-access-from-files` is required to enable access to local files using XMLHttpRequest. Equivalent options for other browser [are available](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/How-to-run-things-locally).

* The `index.html` file is located in the new Sugarizer directory so you will have to use `cd` command line to change location to this directory before running the command.

If everything is right, you should see something like that:

Click on "New user", type your name and choose your color, you should see the Sugarizer home view:

To debug your code, it's a good practice too to use the development console of your browser. See [here](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) how to activate this console on Chrome.


### Edit source code

To develop the activity and to update the source code you will need also a **text editor**. You could use for example [Lime](http://limetext.org/) on Linux, [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org) on Windows, [Atom](https://atom.io/) on MacOS but any other text editor will work as well.

Let's start by opening the Sugarizer directory in your favorite editor. You should see something like that:

You're now ready to start.
